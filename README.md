# Minigame-Jam
Repository for the Minigame Jam!

This is based on the Mobware Minigames framework.

Designed for the playdate, this framework will allow you to compile your own minigame and play it within the overarching minigame framework.

The minigame framework will load a minigame which is programmed similar to a normal playdate game. See the minigame template in the minigame folder for details!
